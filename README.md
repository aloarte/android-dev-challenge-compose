## :scroll: Description
MySoothe application follows a design provide by the android developers contest. It plays with designs that change based on the day/night mode.

Its fully built in kotlin using Jetpack-Compose library.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I work professionally as an Android Developer and I've been tracking this library until I saw an opportunity to test myself doing some developing challenges.

I'm really interested on the power that brings some of the features present in the Jetpack-Compose library.
